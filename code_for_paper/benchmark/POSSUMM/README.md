**POSSUM - PCA Of Sparse, SUper Massive Matrices**

The Rscripts `bestEigen3.R`, `eigenVectorRscript.R`, `eigFromHicRscript.R` are downloaded from https://github.com/aidenlab/EigenVector.
The notebook `benchmark_similarity_POSSUMM.ipynb` is used for calculated the similarity of POSSUMM approximated PC1 versus Juicer created PC1.
